		<textC>Audiences decide if a presentation is worth paying attention to in the first one-to-two minutes.&#xD;&#xD;Lead out with a really good hook.&#xD;&#xD;A hook is something that grabs people's attention. </textC>
		<textD>If the information you present is not complete, the audience may question your credibility.&#xD;&#xD;Consider the answers to the 5w's and 2 h's: who, what, when, where, why, how, and how much.</textD>
		<textE>Make sure that not only will your message be understood, but also not be misunderstood.&#xD;&#xD;Have someone who is not familiar with your content read over your notes.</textE>
		<textF>Ensure that everything you include in the presentation connects logically together and is consistent with your main message.</textF>
		<textG>What do you want your audience to do as a result of the presentation?&#xD;&#xD;The more specific the call to action is, the more successful it will be.</textG>

		<textA>Control Portion Size</textA>
		<textB>Click each number. You must click all of the numbers to continue.</textB>
		<textC>Change the size of your plate.</textC>			
		<textD>We tend to enjoy things more when they're full, so rather than piling mounds of food onto a hubcap-sized platter, just grab a child- or lunch-size plate instead.  The plate is smaller, so you'll think you're eating just as much even though you've greatly reduced your portions.</textD>
		<textE>Use mugs for cereal.</textE>
		<textF>Use small coffee mugs rather than soup bowls to eat your cereal in the morning.  </textF>
		<textG>Box half your meal.</textG>
		<textH>At a restaurant, once your meal is delivered just cut it in half and have the waiter box up half of the dish for another meal.  </textH>
		<textI>Eat a snack.</textI>
		<textJ>Another great way to trick yourself into eating less at the restaurant is by eating a small snack just before you leave.  You'll satisfy at least part of your hunger with the snack, so when you're sitting with a dinner menu in your hands an hour later, you won't feel so enthusiastic to order the quadruple-decker five-cheese lasagna and will instead have something more moderate.</textJ>
		<textK>Chew food thoroughly.</textK>
		<textL>Eat slowly, being certain to chew your food thoroughly before swallowing.  It takes up to 20 minutes for your brain to finally recognize that it's full, so if you eat slowly you'll recognize you're satisfied just as fast as you would if you ate quickly.  And the best part is that you won't feel like you're about to pop like a balloon twenty minutes after the meal.  Make it a game by trying to eat slower than the slowest eater on the table.</textL>

		<textA>Aerobic Exercise</textA>
		<textB>Definition</textB>
		<textC>Easy Exercises</textC>
		<textD>Important Fact</textD>
		<textE>Aerobic exercise is exercise that stimulates the cardiopulmonary system, the heart, and lungs.  It generally includes walking, running, biking, or something similar.</textE>
		<textF>Easy Aerobic Exercises</textF>
		<textG>When going to work, school, or even the store, park your car as far away from the building as possible. You will get a short walk that, although it seems small, really will help develop your heart and lungs.</textG>
		<textH>Every morning before you take a shower or bath, walk or run up and down the stairs a few times.  It will give you a pretty good exercise that will not only strengthen your lungs but also your legs.</textH>
		<textI>If you live closer to your job, you could ride a bike to work.  You will save money by not wasting gasoline, and you will get a great workout.</textI>
		<textJ>Endurance and Stamina</textJ>
		<textK>Cardio or aerobic exercise is great to build your endurance and stamina. When you notice that you are feeling a bit tired and sluggish, a 30-60 second burst of cardio followed by a 30-60 second recovery time (rest) can strengthen your heart and improve your energy.</textK>

		<textA>Strength Training</textA>
		<textB>Definition</textB>
		<textC>Easy Exercises</textC>
		<textD>Important Fact</textD>
		<textE>Strength training is exercise that stimulates muscle growth.  It generally includes the lifting or pushing of weight.</textE>
		<textF>Easy Strength Training Exercises </textF>
		<textG>Before taking a shower in the morning, do a few push-ups by lying flat on your stomach and, while keeping your back as straight as possible, pushing your body off the ground with your arms.  If you find you're too weak to do that, don't worry!  You can make it easier by pushing off from a wall or raised surface, your body slightly diagonal.</textG>
		<textH>Work out your arms by filling a backpack with some books or rocks and lifting it with one hand.</textH>
		<textI>Do some squats when you wake up.  It's easy and it helps you wake up!</textI>
		<textJ>Grab anything you want and lift it.  Remember, you can make an exercise out of anything you can imagine!</textJ>
		<textK>Burning Calories</textK>
		<textL>Strength training (which builds muscle) actually burns more calories overall than cardio. Muscle burns more calories than fat, so tone those arms and legs and you will be burning calories while you sit at your desk or sleep at night!</textL>

		<textA>Flexibility Training</textA>
		<textB>Definition</textB>
		<textC>Easy Exercises</textC>
		<textD>Important Fact</textD>
		<textE>Flexibility training is doing exercises that help improve your flexibility and balance.  It generally includes standing on one foot, stretching your body, and similar movements.</textE>
		<textF>Easy Flexibility Exercises</textF>
		<textG>Yoga is a great way to develop flexibility and balance.  It's easy to learn but hard to perfect, which means you'll be able to do the same few exercises for a long time.  Just spend ten minutes each day on your favorite exercises.</textG>
		<textH>Do some stretching when you get tired at work.  Stand up straight and, only bending your waist, try to touch your toes.</textH>
		<textK>Being Ready for Everyday Life</textK>
		<textL>Increasing your flexibility and balance allows your body to respond and adapt more quickly and easily to the demands of everyday life. </textL>

		<textA>COMMON SAFETY RULES</textA>
		<textB>Click the arrows on the left and right of the screen.</textB>
		<textC>Walk at all times within buildings and be careful going through doors.  You'll greatly decrease the chance of an accident or injury if you avoid running and jumping indoors.</textC>
		<textD>Keep your work area clean.  Aside from the possible dangers it could avoid, it will keep you more organized and presentable.</textD>
		<textE>Don't touch any equipment you haven't been trained or given permission to use.  While using equipment or machinery, be aware that loose clothing and jewelry can get caught inside.</textE>
		<textF>Don't drive or operate machinery if you are drunk, extremely fatigued, or distracted. (Even a tie can get caught in a shredder when you aren't paying attention.)</textF>
		<textG>Smoke only in designated areas, and make sure that the product has been completely extinguished when you finish.</textG>
		<textH>Be aware of flammable materials that can catch on fire, like gas, oil, paint thinner, etc.</textH>
		<textI>If you need to lift something, make sure you lift with your legs, not your back.  If something is too heavy, don't be afraid to ask for help.</textI>
		<textJ>Don't try to reach something by standing on a swivel chair. Often seen as common sense, but many people do it anyway.</textJ>
		<textK>Know what to do in case of an emergency. Pay attention during emergency drills, so you know where emergency exits and designated rendezvous areas are.</textK>
		<textL>Walk at All Times</textL>

Don't be a caveman by eating whenever you have the opportunity.  Limit yourself to eating only a few times a day and stop yourself when you know you're full. Change your mindset, and your actions will follow.&#xD;&#xD;2. Control your portions by tricking your brain.  Use smaller cups and plates, and chew your food slowly.&#xD;&#xD;3. Eat naturally by avoiding processed foods in the supermarket and sticking to fruits, vegetables, beans, and meats.  Natural whole food is cheaper and more nutrient-dense than processed foods, so you'll be getting more for your money.&#xD;&#xD;4. Drink plenty of water by keeping a bottle of water near you at all times and drink it throughout the day.&#xD;&#xD;5. Be patient with yourself!  You'll see results over time, not in a few days, so don't lose hope!&#xD;&#xD;EXERCISE&#xD;&#xD;Even the smallest exercise can help your body in many ways.&#xD;&#xD;Types of exercise&#xD;1.	Aerobic&#xD;2.	Strength&#xD;3.	Flexibility&#xD;&#xD;Don't give up when you don&apos;t see immediate results.  Remember, be patient with yourself.&#xD;&#xD;SAFETY&#xD;&#xD;Use your common sense and remember a good motto to follow regarding safety ' whether it&apos;s on the job or anywhere &#8211; is &quot;Safety is as easy as ABC: Always Be Careful.&quot;&#xD;&#xD;Don&apos;t wait until tomorrow to start healthy practices.
