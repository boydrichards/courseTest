	<h2>About</h2>
	<aside class="leftSide">
		<h3 id="iDo">Do you need a custom course or an Off The Shelve Package?</h3>
			<p id="ParAbout">To help you decide follow these steps. 
				<ol class = "otherOrder">
					<li>Talk to your HR manager about the current needs of the company.</li>
					<li>Decide if the content is company specific or general knowledge.</li>
					<li>Talk about when you will need this training.</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<p id="ParAbout"> If you need the training material right away, or the content is generic, i.e. Leadership Training or Email Etiquette, then our "Off The Shelve Courses" will probably suffice. On the other hand if you don't need the training right away, or the content has to be very company specific, i.e. company policies in specific situations, then a custom course is more likely what you will need.</p>
	</aside>	
	<h3>Custom Builds</h3>
		<p>Custom courses can be tailored directly for your organization. They will take time, and cost more than Off the Shelve courses however. Following are the tools that can be used to build your custom content, with some of their pros and cons.</p>
		<dl>
  		<dt>Adobe Flash</dt>
  		<dd>This allows us the most latitude to give the most dynamic experience you are searching for. This is also the most expensive option, and as of now this platform does not play on most mobile devices.</dd>
  		<dt>Articulate Storyline</dt>
  		<dd>This platform is the best platform for viewing course material on mobile devices. This platform is very expensive to change content, so if next year you want to make small changes to the course using this platform it will probably be more expensive than any of the others. </dd>
  		<dt>Lectora</dt>
  		<dd>This platform takes out a lot of the Dynamic experience but it allows us to give you a lower price than the other two.</dd>
